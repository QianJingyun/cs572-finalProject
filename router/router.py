Query router — public interface for the RAG pipeline.

Teammates import this module and call predict_hop().

Note on deployment: features require the support passages bundled with MedHop.
In a live pipeline where passages aren't available pre-retrieval, the router
would fall back to predict_multi() or use only n_candidates as a proxy.
